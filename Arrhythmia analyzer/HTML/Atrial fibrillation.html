                        <h1>Overview:</h1>
                        <p>Atrial fibrillation (A-fib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots in the heart. A-fib increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.<br>

                            During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (the atria) beat chaotically and irregularly â€” out of sync with the lower chambers (the ventricles) of the heart. For many people, A-fib may have no symptoms.<br> However, A-fib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat (palpitations), shortness of breath or weakness.<br>
                            
                            Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent. Although A-fib itself usually isn't life-threatening, it's a serious medical condition that requires proper treatment to prevent stroke.<br>
                            
                            Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medications, therapy to reset the heart rhythm and catheter procedures to block faulty heart signals.<br>

                        <h4>. Occasional (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation): </h4><p>A-fib symptoms come and go, usually lasting for a few minutes to hours. Sometimes symptoms occur for as long as a week and episodes can happen repeatedly. Symptoms might go away on their own. Some people with occasional A-fib need treatment.</p>
                        <h4>. Persistent: </h4><p>With this type of atrial fibrillation, the heart rhythm doesn't go back to normal on its own. If a person has A-fib symptoms, cardioversion or treatment with medications may be used to restore and maintain a normal heart rhythm.</p>
                        <h4>. Long-standing persistent: </h4><p>This type of atrial fibrillation is continuous and lasts longer than 12 months.</p>
                        <h4>. Permanent: </h4><p>In this type of atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rhythm can't be restored. Medications are needed to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots.</p>

                    (2) If you have chest pain, seek immediate medical help. Chest pain could mean that you're having a heart attack.</p>
