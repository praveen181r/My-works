                        <h1>Overview:</h1>
                        <p>In atrial flutter, the heart's upper chambers (atria) beat too quickly.<br> This causes the heart to beat in a fast, but usually regular, rhythm.<br>

                            Atrial flutter is a type of heart rhythm disorder (arrhythmia) caused by problems in the heart's electrical system.<br>
                            
                            Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation, a common disorder that causes the heart to beat in irregular patterns.<br> People with atrial flutter have a heart rhythm that's more organized and less chaotic than that of atrial fibrillation.<br> Sometimes a person may have episodes of both atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation.<br>
                            
                            People with atrial flutter may not have symptoms.<br> However, the disorder can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and other complications.<br> There are effective treatments for atrial flutter, including medication or procedures designed to scar small areas of heart tissue (ablation).</p>

                        <h4>. Antiarrhythmics: </h4><p>These medicines can be taken as needed to stop an episode. Or you can take them every day to prevent future atrial flutter.</p>
                        <h4>. Electrical cardioversion: </h4><p>This is an outpatient procedure where large electrode patches are placed on your chest and back. Energy is sent through these patches as a shock that is synchronized with your heartbeat. In many cases, this restores normal rhythm. This is typically done with IV sedation so that the shock is not felt. Sometimes your doctor may start you on an antiarrhythmic medicine around the time of the cardioversion. This helps maintain a normal rhythm for a longer period of time after cardioversion. Or it may help the cardioversion to be a success.</p>
                        <h4>. Cardiac ablation: </h4><p>This is a non-surgical, catheter-based procedure that can often cure atrial flutter. It involves threading wires through a vein in your leg to the heart. </p>

                <p> (1) If you have heart palpitations with severe shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting, seek emergency medical attention. If your palpitations are brief and there are no other worrisome signs or symptoms, make an appointment to see your health care provider.</p>
