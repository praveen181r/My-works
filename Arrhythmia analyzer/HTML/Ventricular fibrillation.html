                        <h1>Overview:</h1>
                        <p>Ventricular fibrillation is a type of irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia).<br> During ventricular fibrillation, the lower heart chambers contract in a very rapid and uncoordinated manner.<br> As a result, the heart doesn't pump blood to the rest of the body.<br>

                            Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention.<br> It's the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death.<br>
                            
                            Emergency treatment for ventricular fibrillation includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (AED).<br> Medications, implanted devices or surgery may be recommended to prevent episodes of ventricular fibrillation.<br>
                            
                            Ventricular fibrillation may also be called VFib, V-fib or VF.</p>

                        <h4>. Coarse ventricular fibrillation: </h4><p>When the fibrillation is strong, the peaks are taller and the valleys are deeper. It’s called “coarse” because the line is anything but smooth.</p>
                        <h4>. Fine ventricular fibrillation: </h4><p>When the peaks and valleys are short and shallow, this is called fine ventricular fibrillation.</p>

                <h1>When to see a doctor:</h1>

                <p> (1) Call 108 or your local emergency number.<br>
                    (2) If the person is unconscious, check for a pulse.<br>
                    (3) If no pulse, begin CPR to help keep blood flowing through the body until an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available. The American Heart Association recommends hands-only CPR. Push hard and fast on the person's chest — about 100 to 120 times a minute. It's not necessary to check the person's airway or deliver rescue breaths. Continue until emergency medical help arrives.<br>
                    (4) Use an AED as soon as it's available. Deliver a shock following the prompts on the device.</p>
